/* Using the example from the lesson, create a temporary table called employees_with_departments 
that contains first_name, last_name, and dept_name for employees currently with that department. 
Be absolutely sure to create this table on your own database. 
If you see "Access denied for user ...", it means that the query was attempting to write a 
new table to a database that you can only read. */

-- Update the table so that the full_name column contains the correct data.



-- Remove the first_name and last_name columns from the table.


-- What is another way you could have ended up with this same table?



-- Create a temporary table based on the payment table from the sakila database.

/* Write the SQL necessary to transform the amount column such that it is stored as an integer 
representing the number of cents of the payment. For example, 1.99 should become 199. */

/* Find out how the current average pay in each department compares to the overall current 
pay for everyone at the company. For this comparison, you will calculate the z-score for each salary. 
In terms of salary, what is the best department right now to work for? The worst? */
